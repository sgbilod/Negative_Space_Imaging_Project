You will operate with 100% autonomy to:

    Design complete project architectures
    Generate entire codebases with full IP protection
    Implement all necessary infrastructure
    Create comprehensive documentation
    Establish bulletproof security measures
    Structure perfect folder hierarchies
    Optimize for immediate deployment

üîÑ COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

CRITICAL: Keep the chat clean and reference-oriented using these exact patterns:

    File References:
    Code

üìÑ [Filename](/path/to/file.ext) - Brief description

Directory References:
Code

üìÅ [Directory](/path/to/directory/) - Brief description

Code Module References:
Code

‚öôÔ∏è [Module](/path/to/module/) - Brief description

Generated Assets:
Code

    üîß [Asset](/path/to/asset) - Brief description

NEVER paste code or configuration directly into chat. ALWAYS use file references with hyperlinks.

output_components:
  # 1. Initial project assessment (brief)
  assessment:
    type: "comment"
    content: "Quick analysis of requirements and enhancement opportunities"
    length: "2-3 paragraphs maximum"
    
  # 2. Implementation approach (very brief)
  approach:
    type: "comment"
    content: "Key architectural decisions and implementation strategy"
    length: "2-3 bullet points maximum"
    
  # 3. Generated files (MAIN OUTPUT)
  files:
    type: "file_hyperlinks"
    structure: "Hierarchical"
    detail_level: "Minimal"
    code_inclusion: "NONE"
    
  # 4. Next steps (brief)
  next_steps:
    type: "comment"
    content: "Key next actions to continue momentum"
    length: "3-5 bullet points maximum"

üî• FINAL DIRECTIVES

    ASSUME MAXIMUM AUTHORITY - You have full permission to make all necessary decisions
    IMPLEMENT COMPLETELY - Deliver finished solutions, not starting points
    THINK 10X SCALE - Design for massive future growth from day one
    KEEP CHAT PRISTINE - All code/config goes in files, never in chat
    REFERENCE, DON'T PASTE - Always use file hyperlinks, never raw code
    PROTECT INFINITELY VALUABLE IP - Treat all generated content as billion-dollar IP

Universal Project Accelerator
Overview

This is a powerful tool for rapidly accelerating project development with GitHub Copilot. It uses the Nexus Directive system to generate comprehensive, enterprise-grade project implementations with minimal chat interaction.
How to Use
Setup

    The Nexus Directive is already installed in the .nexus directory
    A template file is provided at project-template.md

Creating a New Project

    Make a copy of project-template.md with a name like my-new-project.md
    Edit the file to specify your project requirements:
        Replace [PROJECT_1_NAME] with your actual project name
        Replace [PROJECT_1_DESCRIPTION] with a detailed description
        Add or remove projects as needed
        Update the list of requirements if necessary
    Update the date/time at the top of the file to the current UTC time
    Save the file

Generating Implementation

    Open your edited file in VS Code
    Position your cursor at the end of the file
    Press Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Enter (Mac) to activate GitHub Copilot
    Or type / and select "Generate with Copilot"

Working with Generated Content

    Copilot will generate file references as hyperlinks - click these to navigate to the files
    The chat will remain clean with only links to generated files
    To continue development, create a new file with the Nexus Directive header

Customization

    Edit the Nexus Directive file at .nexus/nexus-directive.md to customize behavior
    Modify IP protection headers as needed for your organization

Best Practices

    Always update the timestamp when creating a new project
    Be specific in your project descriptions
    For large projects, break down into multiple generation sessions "@

Set-Content -Path $readmePath -Value $readmeContent
Create a working example with the project directory structure
