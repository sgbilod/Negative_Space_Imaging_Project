# Step-by-Step Onboarding for Contributors

1. Clone the repository and review `EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` for project goals.
2. Explore the `src/` directory and read module docstrings for architecture overview.
3. Run unit tests in `src/tests/` to validate your environment.
4. Review and extend blockchain, compression, and time-series features in core modules.
5. Use and improve proof-of-concept demos: `spatial_auth_demo.py`, `spatial_visualization_demo.py`.
6. Document any changes and update workflow summaries in `README.md`.
7. Join regular project reviews and contribute to continuous improvement cycles.

# Step-by-Step Onboarding for Users

1. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
2. Use `NegativeSpaceReconstructor` for image-based negative space analysis, compression, and indexing.
3. Use `NegativeSpaceCoordinates` for spatial signature, region identification, and blockchain compatibility.
4. Use `MultiObjectMapper` for multi-object, configuration mapping, and time-series tracking.
5. Run `spatial_auth_demo.py` and `spatial_visualization_demo.py` for hands-on demos.
6. Refer to module docstrings and `README.md` for workflow guidance.
7. Reach out for support or join onboarding sessions as scheduled.
## Workflow Summary

1. Acquire and preprocess images
2. Extract features and reconstruct negative space
3. Map, compress, and index negative space regions
4. Generate spatial/configuration signatures
5. Tokenize and authenticate via blockchain stubs
6. Track configuration changes over time
7. Visualize and validate with proof-of-concept demos

## Demos

- [Spatial Visualization Demo](spatial_visualization_demo.py)

# Onboarding Guide: Negative Space Imaging Project

## For Contributors
- Review the executive checklist in `EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`
- Explore core modules in `src/`
- Run and extend unit tests in `src/tests/`
- Use blockchain and smart contract stubs in all modules
- Implement and test compression, indexing, and time-series features
- Try proof-of-concept demos: `spatial_auth_demo.py`, `spatial_visualization_demo.py`

## For Users
- Use `NegativeSpaceReconstructor` for image-based negative space analysis, compression, and indexing
- Use `NegativeSpaceCoordinates` for spatial signature, region identification, and blockchain compatibility
- Use `MultiObjectMapper` for multi-object, configuration mapping, and time-series tracking

## Automation & Protocols
- Sovereign Intelligence Protocols automate validation and review
- All modules are extensible and ready for advanced feature integration
