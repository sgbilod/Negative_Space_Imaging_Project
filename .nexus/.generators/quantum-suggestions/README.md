# HDR Quantum Suggestions - VS Code Extension

High-dimensional quantum-enhanced code suggestions with consciousness integration.

## Features

- Quantum state suggestion generation
- Consciousness-based pattern recognition
- Multi-dimensional code analysis
- Reality-anchored completions
- Temporal coherence preservation

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or higher
- Node.js 16.x or higher
