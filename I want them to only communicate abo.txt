I want them to only communicate about dependencies being installed and used to restrict duplicate or opposing needs for versions of python for example and similar functions

Perfect â€” that makes the goal much more focused:
You want Copilot (or your development environment) in multiple VS Code projects to coordinate dependency management, so they donâ€™t install conflicting versions of the same packages (like Python libraries), or duplicate them unnecessarily.


---

ðŸ§  Goal Recap:

You want:

Project A to know which dependencies (and versions) Project B is using

And vice versa

So that Copilot (or at least you) can avoid:

Version conflicts (e.g. Python 3.11 vs 3.9 incompatibilities)

Installing duplicate or redundant packages

Conflicting dependency trees (e.g. numpy==1.25 vs 1.19)




---

âœ… 1. Shared Dependency Manifest (the simplest solution)

Create a shared dependency file that both VS Code projects can read from (and optionally write to), such as:

A global_requirements.txt

A shared_env.yaml (for Conda)

A pyproject.toml or Pipfile for coordinated projects

Or even a manual markdown file like shared_dependencies.md


Example (requirements.txt):

# shared_requirements.txt
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.2.0
scikit-learn==1.4.2

How to Use:

1. In both VS Code projects, point to this file as a reference:

Use comments in your own requirements.txt like:
# Refer to ../shared/shared_requirements.txt



2. Ask Copilot Chat:

When adding a dependency, check if it's already in shared_requirements.txt and use the same version.



Optional Automation:

Write a script that:

Parses the shared file

Compares it with each projectâ€™s local requirements

Warns of mismatches or duplicates




---

âœ… 2. Use a Centralized Virtual Environment

Instead of each project managing its own Python environment:

Create a shared Python virtual environment using venv or conda

Activate it in both projects


python -m venv ~/shared-env
source ~/shared-env/bin/activate

Or for Conda:

conda create -n shared-env python=3.10
conda activate shared-env

Then in each VS Code project:

1. Set the Python interpreter to ~/shared-env


2. Let Copilot generate dependencies, but theyâ€™ll be installed into the same environment



> Benefit: No conflicts, one place to update or fix things




---

âœ… 3. Add Dependency Context for Copilot Chat

You can give Copilot context by doing the following:

1. Open both projects in a multi-root workspace in VS Code:

File â†’ Add Folder to Workspaceâ€¦



2. In Copilot Chat, prompt it like:

In both projects, please ensure the dependencies do not conflict.
Here is Project Aâ€™s requirements.txt and Project Bâ€™s.
Suggest a merged compatible version.


3. Or ask:

Does the version of 'requests' used in Project B conflict with the one in Project A?



Copilot Chat will then be able to compare and give advice.


---

âœ… 4. Use pipdeptree or poetry to Compare Dependencies

You can run pipdeptree or poetry lock in both projects and compare the outputs manually or with a diff tool.

> Bonus: You can paste the outputs into Copilot Chat and ask:

Compare these two pipdeptree outputs. Highlight conflicts or duplicates.




---

âœ… 5. Automatically Sync Requirements Between Projects (Advanced)

Write a simple script like:

# sync_deps.py
from pathlib import Path

shared_file = Path("../shared/shared_requirements.txt")
local_file = Path("requirements.txt")

shared_deps = set(shared_file.read_text().splitlines())
local_deps = set(local_file.read_text().splitlines())

conflicts = local_deps - shared_deps
print("Dependencies in local but not in shared:", conflicts)

Schedule it to run pre-commit or with a VS Code task.

Summary: Your Options

Solution Purpose Complexity

Shared requirements.txt Avoid duplication ðŸŸ¢ Easy
Shared venv / Conda env Guarantee compatibility ðŸŸ¡ Medium
Copilot Chat w/ context Manual checking + AI help ðŸŸ¡ Medium
pipdeptree / poetry lock Audit conflicts ðŸŸ¡ Medium
Multi-root workspace Compare both projects ðŸŸ¡ Medium
Automation scripts Auto detect & sync ðŸ”´ Advanced
