# Negative Space Imaging Project Documentation

## Automated Review & Feature Evolution

This documentation is regularly updated as features evolve. The following practices are enforced:
- Automated code reviews and test runs are performed after each major change.
- Benchmarking and profiling are executed to ensure performance and scalability.
- GPU and distributed computing features (CuPy, Dask) are integrated and validated.
- All test results and profiling outputs are reviewed and summarized here.

## Recent Review Summary (2025-08-16)
- CuPy and Dask successfully installed; CUDA path warning present (set CUDA_PATH for full GPU support).
- Demo script runs with benchmarking and profiling; blockchain and quantum encryption features validated.
- Test suite executed: 18 tests run, 6 failures, 6 errors, 1 skipped. Key failure: `test_complete_workflow` returned False.
- Benchmark and profiling output saved to `benchmark_profile.txt`.

## Next Steps
- Address test failures and errors in the test suite.
- Resolve CUDA path warning for full GPU acceleration.
- Continue regular reviews and update documentation as features evolve.
