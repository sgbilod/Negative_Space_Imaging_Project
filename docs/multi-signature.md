# Multi-Signature Verification System

The Multi-Signature Verification System is a cornerstone of the Negative Space Imaging platform's security architecture, ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and compliance of all image processing results.

## Overview

Medical and astronomical image processing often requires multiple stakeholders to validate results before they can be considered authoritative. The Multi-Signature Verification System provides cryptographic assurance that processing results have been approved by the required parties and have not been tampered with at any point in the process.

## Key Features

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Uses asymmetric cryptography to ensure the integrity and authenticity of processing results
- **Multiple Verification Modes**: Supports threshold, sequential, and role-based verification approaches
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Designed to meet healthcare security and privacy requirements
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Logs all verification attempts, approvals, and rejections
- **Integration with Workflow**: Seamlessly integrates with the image acquisition and processing pipeline

## Verification Modes

The system supports three distinct verification modes to accommodate different organizational needs and compliance requirements:

### 1. Threshold Signature (m-of-n)

Requires a minimum number of authorized signers (m) from a larger pool (n) to approve results.

**Use Case**: General medical imaging where any 3 of 5 authorized radiologists must approve findings.

```bash
python multi_signature_demo.py --mode threshold --signatures 5 --threshold 3
```

### 2. Sequential Signature

Requires signatures in a specific order or sequence, ensuring a proper approval chain.

**Use Case**: Clinical trials where an analyst, supervisor, and compliance officer must approve in sequence.

```bash
python multi_signature_demo.py --mode sequential --signatures 3
```

### 3. Role-Based Signature

Requires signatures from specific organizational roles, ensuring cross-functional verification.

**Use Case**: Critical diagnosis where an analyst, physician, and administrator must all approve.

```bash
python multi_signature_demo.py --mode role-based --roles analyst,physician,admin
```

## Technical Implementation

The Multi-Signature Verification System uses modern cryptographic techniques:

1. **Key Generation**: Each authorized signer has a public-private key pair generated using RSA-2048
2. **Data Hashing**: Image processing results are hashed using SHA-256
3. **Signature Creation**: Signers use their private keys to sign the data hash
4. **Verification**: The system verifies signatures using the signers' public keys
5. **Status Tracking**: The system tracks the status of each signature request (pending, partial, complete, rejected, expired)

## Integration with Secure Workflow

The Multi-Signature Verification System is fully integrated with the secure imaging workflow:

```bash
# Run the complete secure workflow with threshold signatures
python cli.py workflow --mode threshold --signatures 5 --threshold 3

# Verify specific processing results
python cli.py verify --input results.json --mode threshold --signatures 5 --threshold 3

# View the verification audit log
python cli.py audit --view --log security_audit.json
```

## Security Considerations

- **Private Key Protection**: Private keys should never be shared and should be protected with strong passwords
- **Signer Authentication**: The system assumes that signers have been properly authenticated before signing
- **Timeout Controls**: Signature requests expire after a configurable period to prevent security issues
- **Audit Logging**: All signature operations are logged for compliance and security analysis

## Examples

### Threshold Signature Process

1. Image processing results are hashed and a signature request is created
2. The request is distributed to 5 authorized signers
3. At least 3 signers must sign the request with their private keys
4. Once 3 valid signatures are collected, the request is marked as complete
5. The system verifies that the signatures are valid and the data has not been tampered with

### Sequential Signature Process

1. Image processing results are hashed and a signature request is created
2. The first signer (e.g., analyst) signs the request
3. The second signer (e.g., supervisor) can only sign after the first
4. The third signer (e.g., compliance officer) can only sign after the second
5. Once all signers have signed in the correct sequence, the request is complete

### Role-Based Signature Process

1. Image processing results are hashed and a signature request is created
2. Signers from different roles (analyst, physician, administrator) must sign
3. Multiple signers may exist for each role, but at least one from each required role must sign
4. Once all required roles have provided signatures, the request is complete

## Future Enhancements

- **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration**: For enhanced private key protection
- **Blockchain Integration**: For immutable verification records
- **Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**: Future-proofing against quantum computing threats
- **Mobile Signing Application**: For convenient secure signing from mobile devices
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional authentication factors before signing
