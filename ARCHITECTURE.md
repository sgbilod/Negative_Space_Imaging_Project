# Negative Space Imaging Project Architecture

## Overview
This project follows a sophisticated 5-layer vertical integration model combined with horizontal cross-cutting concerns, as defined in the Framework Stacking & Layering Architecture.

## Vertical Integration Layers

### 1. Base Layer
- `/security` - Security frameworks and protocols
- `/core` - Core infrastructure and foundational components
- `/auth` - Authentication and authorization systems

### 2. Middleware Layer
- `/integration` - Cross-system communication and integration
- `/data` - Data management and persistence
- `/messaging` - Inter-service communication protocols

### 3. Application Layer
- `/src/business` - Core business logic
- `/src/ui` - User interface components
- `/src/services` - Service implementations

### 4. Intelligence Layer
- `/ai` - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- `/analytics` - Decision support and analysis
- `/optimization` - Performance optimization systems

### 5. Meta Layer
- `/monitoring` - System monitoring and observability
- `/metrics` - Performance metrics and tracking
- `/automation` - Self-improvement and automation

## Horizontal Integration (Cross-Cutting Concerns)

- `/aspects` - Cross-cutting code and aspects
- `/shared` - Common utilities and shared resources
- `/logging` - Centralized logging system
- `/events` - Event handling and propagation

## Integration Protocols

### Vertical Integration
- Bottom-up communication through layer interfaces
- Top-down control through command patterns
- Layer isolation with defined boundaries

### Horizontal Integration
- Aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting concerns
- Shared resource management
- Event-driven communication

## Best Practices

1. **Layer Isolation**
   - Each layer should only depend on layers below it
   - Use interfaces for cross-layer communication
   - Minimize direct dependencies between layers

2. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Use aspect-oriented approaches for logging, security, etc.
   - Centralize shared functionality in appropriate directories
   - Maintain consistent patterns across layers

3. **Security First**
   - Security is implemented at all layers
   - Base layer provides core security infrastructure
   - Each layer adds appropriate security measures

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use the optimization layer for performance improvements
   - Monitor and measure using the meta layer
   - Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **New Features**
   - Identify the appropriate layer for implementation
   - Consider cross-cutting concerns
   - Follow established patterns within each layer

2. **Dependencies**
   - Maintain clear dependency direction (downward)
   - Use dependency injection where appropriate
   - Document all cross-layer dependencies

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for each layer
   - Integration tests for layer boundaries
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
