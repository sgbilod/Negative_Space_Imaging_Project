Here is a comprehensive, actionable plan to automate, organize, and scale project creation and management for Stephen Bilodeau, maximizing ease, organization, and leveraging all available tools (VS Code, desktop, mobile, terminal, etc.):

1. Define a Universal Project Template
Create a master template repository on GitHub (or locally) with:
README.md, .gitignore, LICENSE
src, tests, docs, /configs, workflows
Pre-configured CI/CD, linting, and automation scripts
Preferred Method:

Use GitHub’s “Template Repository” feature for instant project scaffolding.
Locally, keep a copy in a dedicated “Templates” folder for offline use.
2. Automate Project Creation Across All Platforms
A. VS Code
Install extensions: GitHub Repositories, Copilot, CodeGPT, Project Manager.
Create VS Code tasks/snippets to scaffold new projects from the template.
Use the “Use this template” button for new GitHub projects.
B. Terminal/PowerShell
Write a CLI script (Python, Bash, PowerShell) to:
Prompt for project name, stack, location
Clone/copy template, initialize git, set up remote
Open in VS Code automatically
Example Command:
newproject "ProjectName" --template "base" --open

C. Desktop App
Use a simple GUI tool (e.g., Python Tkinter, Electron) to select template, name, and location.
Automate folder creation and VS Code launch.
D. Mobile
Use GitHub mobile app for repo creation (less ideal for code scaffolding).
For code, sync with cloud storage (OneDrive, Dropbox) and edit on desktop.
3. Centralize and Track All Projects
Store all projects in a dedicated folder (e.g., ~/Projects/StephenBilodeau/)
Use consistent naming: type-purpose-date (e.g., ai-image-2025)
Maintain a master index file or dashboard (Markdown, Notion, GitHub Projects board)
4. Automate Migration and Organization of Existing Projects
Write a migration script to:
Audit all existing folders
Move code to src, tests to tests, docs to docs
Initialize git, push to GitHub if not already
Update index/dashboard
5. Enforce Author and Ownership
Set up .github/CODEOWNERS in every repo:

* @StephenBilodeau
Add author info to README.md and license files.
Use GitHub settings to restrict collaborators.
6. Maximize Automation and Pro+ Features
Enable Copilot Chat and CodeGPT in every repo for code generation, review, and automation.
Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, linting, and dependency updates.
Automate documentation generation (e.g., with Sphinx, MkDocs).
7. Onboarding and Documentation
Create a “How to Start a New Project” guide in the template repo.
Document all scripts, commands, and workflows for future reference.
8. Preferred Workflow Summary
Platform	Action/Tool	Steps to Create/Save Project
VS Code	Template repo, tasks, ext.	Use template, run scaffold task, open/edit
Terminal/PS	CLI script, git	Run script, auto-init, open in VS Code
Desktop App	GUI tool	Select template, name, location, launch
Mobile	GitHub app, cloud sync	Create repo, sync code, edit on desktop
9. Next Steps for Full Automation
Create and publish the master template repo.
Write and deploy CLI/PowerShell scripts for project creation and migration.
Set up VS Code tasks/snippets for instant scaffolding.
Audit and migrate all existing projects to the new structure.
Document everything in a central onboarding guide.
If you want ready-to-use scripts, VS Code tasks, or a desktop GUI, specify your preferred platform and I’ll generate them for you.
You will always be the sole author, with AI as your only collaborator when desired.
