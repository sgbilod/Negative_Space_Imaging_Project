# Secrets Directory

This directory is intended to store sensitive information like passwords, tokens, certificates, etc., which are required for the deployment but should not be committed to version control.

## Usage

1. Create necessary secret files in this directory according to the deployment requirements
2. Make sure not to commit these files to version control (they are ignored by the .gitignore file)
3. For production deployments, consider using a secure secrets management system like:
   - Kubernetes Secrets
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Docker Swarm Secrets

## Example Files

The deployment may require the following secret files:

- `db_password.txt`: Database password
- `ssl_cert.pem`: SSL certificate
- `ssl_key.pem`: SSL private key
- `api_token.txt`: API access token

## Security Notice

Never commit actual secrets to version control. The example files provided in the repository are for development and testing purposes only and should be replaced with secure values in any production environment.
