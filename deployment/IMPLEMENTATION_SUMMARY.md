## Usage

### Traditional CLI Usage

The multi-node deployment system can be used through the main CLI:

```bash
# Setup the deployment environment
python cli.py multi-node setup

# Deploy the multi-node cluster
python cli.py multi-node deploy --config deployment/multi_node_config.yaml

# Integrate with existing system
python cli.py multi-node integrate

# Check deployment status
python cli.py multi-node status
```

### Enhanced Deployment Script

The new enhanced deployment script provides a more streamlined experience:

```bash
# Deploy with Docker Compose in development environment
python deployment/deploy.py --type docker-compose --environment development

# Build images before deployment
python deployment/deploy.py --type docker-compose --build

# Deploy with Kubernetes in production environment
python deployment/deploy.py --type kubernetes --environment production --namespace nsi-prod

# Check deployment status
python deployment/deploy.py --status

# Stop and clean up deployment
python deployment/deploy.py --stop
```
