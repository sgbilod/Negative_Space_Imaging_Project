# Performance Monitoring System

## Overview

The Performance Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing the performance of the Negative Space Imaging Project. It provides real-time insights into system resources, application metrics, database performance, and high-performance computing (HPC) resources.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Dashboards**: Visual representations of system and application performance
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage tracking
- **Application Performance**: Request tracing, error rates, and response times
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization, slow query detection, and connection pooling
- **HPC Integration**: Monitor distributed computing nodes and job performance
- **Alerting System**: Configurable alerts for performance issues
- **Historical Data**: Long-term storage of performance metrics for trend analysis

## Architecture

The Performance Monitoring System consists of several components:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Collects data from various sources including system resources, application code, database, and HPC nodes
2. **Data Storage**: Stores performance metrics in a time-series database
3. **Dashboard**: Web-based interface for visualizing performance data
4. **Alerting**: Notifies administrators of performance issues
5. **API**: RESTful API for programmatic access to performance data

## Deployment

The Performance Monitoring System can be deployed using Docker:

```bash
# Deploy with standard configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.performance.yml up -d

# Deploy monitoring only
docker-compose -f docker-compose.performance.yml up -d monitoring
```

## Configuration

The system is configured using the `performance_monitoring_config.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

- **General Settings**: Enable/disable monitoring, logging level, and sampling intervals
- **System Resource Monitoring**: Configure thresholds for CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring
- **Application Monitoring**: Configure request tracing, database monitoring, and error tracking
- **HPC Monitoring**: Configure monitoring for high-performance computing resources
- **Alerting**: Configure alert channels, rules, and thresholds
- **Dashboards**: Configure dashboard layouts, refresh intervals, and time ranges

## Usage

### Accessing Dashboards

Once deployed, the dashboards can be accessed at:

- **Main Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090

### API Endpoints

The Performance Monitoring System provides RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access to performance data:

- **GET /api/v1/metrics**: Get current system metrics
- **GET /api/v1/metrics/history**: Get historical metrics
- **GET /api/v1/metrics/hpc**: Get HPC-specific metrics
- **GET /api/v1/alerts**: Get current alerts
- **POST /api/v1/alerts/acknowledge**: Acknowledge an alert

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Dashboard not loading**: Check if the monitoring service is running with `docker-compose ps`
- **Missing metrics**: Verify that the metrics collection is enabled in the configuration
- **High CPU usage**: The metrics collection process itself may be consuming resources; adjust the sampling interval

## Advanced Features

### Query Optimization

The Performance Monitoring System includes an advanced query optimization engine that:

1. Detects patterns in SQL queries
2. Identifies inefficient queries
3. Suggests optimizations
4. Can automatically apply optimizations in development environments

### Memory Profiling

The memory profiling feature tracks:

1. Memory usage over time
2. Memory leaks
3. Object allocation patterns
4. Garbage collection efficiency

### Distributed Tracing

For complex, distributed operations, the system provides:

1. End-to-end request tracing
2. Service dependency mapping
3. Bottleneck identification
4. Latency analysis across services
