# Negative Space Imaging Project: Complete Documentation

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a novel system for analyzing and utilizing the negative space in 3D reconstructions from 2D images. The core concept involves extracting unique spatial signatures from the "empty" regions between objects, creating unforgeable data patterns that can be integrated with blockchain technology for various applications including encryption, authentication, and unique token generation.

## Project Evolution
Starting with single-object negative space analysis, the project has evolved to incorporate multiple reference objects, creating "interstitial negative space" - the void between multiple known points - which generates exponentially more complex and unique spatial relationships.

### Development Workflow with AI Automation

1. Start with detailed comments describing your algorithm's intent
2. Let Copilot generate implementation code based on your descriptions
3. Refine and customize the generated code to match your unique approach
4. Generate unit tests with Copilot to validate functionality
5. Use Copilot Chat within VS Code to explain and debug complex algorithms

## Astronomical Implementation Example

For implementing with celestial bodies as reference points:

1. Each celestial body becomes a reference node with known coordinates
2. The negative space forms complex polyhedra between these nodes
3. As planets move, these shapes transform continuously, creating "time-variant spatial signatures"
4. These signatures can be hashed and used as unforgeable tokens on a blockchain
