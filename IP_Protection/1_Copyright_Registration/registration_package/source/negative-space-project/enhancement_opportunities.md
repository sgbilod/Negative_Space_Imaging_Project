1. Develop a unified API layer that standardizes security interactions across all systems
2. Create a centralized policy management interface
3. Implement cross-system security tokens that carry validation across components

**Revenue Impact:** Increases enterprise adoption by providing a comprehensive security solution, potentially increasing revenue by 30-40% through higher-tier package offerings.

### Astronomical Event Orchestration

**Current State:** TACS can use astronomical events as access triggers, while the Quantum Entangled Ledger uses celestial alignments for contract execution.

**Enhancement Opportunity:** Create a shared astronomical calculation engine that:
- Centralizes astronomical calculations
- Provides predictive event scheduling
- Enables complex cross-system triggers based on astronomical conditions
- Allows temporal contracts to control access to specific data nodes

**Implementation Path:**
1. Extract astronomical calculation logic to a shared library
2. Enhance precision using additional astronomical data sources
3. Create an event prediction and notification system
4. Develop visualization tools for upcoming astronomical triggers

**Revenue Impact:** Enables new use cases in scientific research, education, and artistic installations with revenue potential of $2-5M annually.
