# End-to-End Test Plan for Negative Space Imaging Project

## Test Areas
- Image acquisition and preprocessing
- 3D reconstruction and negative space mapping
- Multi-object mapping and configuration tracking
- Spatial signature generation and hashing
- Data compression and retrieval
- Temporal variant analysis
- Blockchain tokenization and verification
- Mobile app workflows (camera, AR, field verification)

## Example Test: Spatial Signature Generation
- Validate signature generation for sample coordinates
- Ensure uniqueness for different spatial configurations
- Confirm output format and length
