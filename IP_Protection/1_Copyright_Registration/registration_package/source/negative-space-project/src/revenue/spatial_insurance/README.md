# Predictive Insurance Adjudication & Risk Modeling (Project "Cassandra")

This module implements a predictive risk modeling system for insurance claims adjudication. It analyzes the changing spatial signatures between a threat's predicted path and stationary properties to generate real-time risk assessments and automate claim processing.

## Key Components

### GeoPoint
Represents a geographical point with latitude, longitude, and optional elevation. Includes methods for calculating distances between points.

### Property
Represents an insured property with geographical information, value, and risk factors.

### NaturalDisaster
Represents a natural disaster or threat with a predicted path, intensity, and radius of effect.

### ClaimProbabilityScore
Represents a probability score for an insurance claim, including expected damage ratio and contributing factors.

### InsuranceClaim
Represents an insurance claim for a property, including evidence, claimant information, and adjudication results.

### PredictiveModelingService
The main service class providing methods for risk assessment, claim adjudication, resource allocation, and preventative action incentives.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the service
service = PredictiveModelingService(
    spatial_generator=SpatialSignatureGenerator(),
    quantum_ledger=QuantumEntangledLedger(),
    randomness_oracle=AcausalRandomnessOracle()
)

# Register a property
property = service.register_property({
    "location": {
        "latitude": 34.0522,
        "longitude": -118.2437,
        "elevation": 93
    },
    "value": 1500000,
    "risk_factors": {
        "property_type": "residential",
        "age": 15,
        "construction_type": 8,
        "previous_claims": 0,
        "preventative_measures": 7
    },
    "owner_info": {
        "name": "John Smith",
        "contact": "john.smith@example.com"
    }
})

# Register a disaster
disaster = service.register_disaster({
    "disaster_type": "hurricane",
    "current_location": {
        "latitude": 25.7617,
        "longitude": -80.1918
    },
    "predicted_path": [
        {"latitude": 26.1224, "longitude": -80.1373},
        {"latitude": 27.9506, "longitude": -82.4572},
        {"latitude": 29.7604, "longitude": -95.3698}
    ],
    "intensity": 8.5,
    "radius_of_effect": 150
})

# Calculate claim probability
probability = service.calculate_claim_probability(
    property_id=property.property_id,
    disaster_id=disaster.disaster_id
)

# Submit and adjudicate a claim
claim = service.submit_claim({
    "property_id": property.property_id,
    "disaster_id": disaster.disaster_id,
    "claim_amount": 250000,
    "claim_description": "Roof damage and flooding",
    "claim_evidence": {
        "photos": ["url1", "url2"],
        "adjuster_report": "report_id"
    },
    "claimant_info": {
        "name": "John Smith",
        "contact": "john.smith@example.com"
    }
})

adjudicated_claim = service.adjudicate_claim(claim.claim_id, auto_approve_threshold=0.8)
```

## Revenue Streams

1. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Licensing**: License the entire Cassandra platform to insurance carriers on a subscription basis.
2. **Predictive Data Feeds**: Sell anonymized, real-time "Risk Horizon" data feeds to hedge funds, municipalities, and logistics companies.
3. **Per-Claim Automation Fee**: A small fee for every claim that is successfully processed through the automated adjudication system.

## Integration Points

- **Quantum Entangled Ledger**: Used for notarizing claims and adjudication results, ensuring immutability and verification.
- **Acausal Randomness Oracle**: Provides true randomness for more accurate risk modeling.
- **Spatial Signature Generator**: Used for generating spatial signatures of properties and disaster paths.

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Resource Allocation
The system can suggest optimal resource allocation based on risk horizon data, helping insurers proactively stage resources and send targeted warnings.

### Preventative Action Incentives
The system can generate preventative action incentives for specific properties, offering deductible reductions for actions taken before a disaster hits.

### Risk Horizon Data
Anonymized risk data can be generated for downstream applications, providing valuable insights for hedge funds, municipalities, and logistics companies.
