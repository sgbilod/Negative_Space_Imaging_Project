# Mnemonic Data Architecture (Project "Mnemosyne")

This module implements a new data storage architecture that encodes information within virtual negative spaces, creating a spatial-mnemonic system that leverages the human brain's powerful spatial memory (the "Method of Loci"). It's a file system you can literally "walk through".

## Key Components

### AIDataCartographer
An AI system that automatically organizes vast datasets into an intuitive 3D "Memory Palace." It learns how users or teams work and arranges data in the most logically accessible spatial layout.

### SpatialNode
A node in the spatial data architecture representing a piece of data placed at a specific position in 3D space. Nodes can contain any type of content, from files to folders to tags.

### Cluster
A group of semantically related nodes positioned in proximity within the 3D space. Clusters provide visual and conceptual organization to the data landscape.

### Path
A predefined journey through the spatial data structure, useful for guided tours, presentations, or navigation aids.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the Mnemonic Data Architecture
mnemonic_system = MnemonicDataArchitecture()

# Add data nodes to the system
document_node = mnemonic_system.add_node(
    data_type="document",
    content={
        "title": "Project Proposal",
        "text": "This is a proposal for a new project that leverages spatial data...",
        "author": "Jane Smith"
    },
    metadata={
        "name": "Project Proposal",
        "tags": ["proposal", "project", "planning"],
        "creation_date": "2025-07-15"
    }
)

image_node = mnemonic_system.add_node(
    data_type="image",
    content={
        "path": "/images/diagram.png",
        "dimensions": [1920, 1080],
        "format": "PNG"
    },
    metadata={
        "name": "System Architecture Diagram",
        "tags": ["diagram", "architecture", "technical"]
    }
)

# Connect related nodes
mnemonic_system.update_node(
    node_id=document_node["node_id"],
    updates={
        "connections": [image_node["node_id"]]
    }
)

# Create a cluster for project materials
project_cluster = mnemonic_system.create_cluster(
    name="Project Planning Materials",
    center=[50.0, 50.0, 50.0],
    radius=15.0,
    theme="corporate",
    metadata={
        "project_id": "PROJ-2025-007",
        "priority": "high"
    }
)

# Automatically organize a set of data items
data_items = [
    {
        "type": "document",
        "name": "Meeting Minutes",
        "content": "Minutes from the project kickoff meeting...",
        "tags": ["meeting", "kickoff", "minutes"]
    },
    {
        "type": "spreadsheet",
        "name": "Budget Forecast",
        "content": {"cells": "...", "sheets": ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"]},
        "tags": ["budget", "finance", "forecast"]
    },
    # ... more items
]

auto_result = mnemonic_system.auto_organize_data(data_items)

# Query related items using the cognitive API
cognitive_query = mnemonic_system.query_cognitive_api({
    "type": "related_to",
    "node_id": document_node["node_id"]
})

# Export the mnemonic architecture state
state = mnemonic_system.export_state()
```

## Key Features

### Multi-Modal Interaction
The system is designed to be accessed via traditional screens but is optimized for VR/AR interfaces. Users can literally "pick up" data points, "walk" down corridors of related research, and "see" connections between disparate ideas as physical bridges.

### AI Data Cartographer
The built-in AI automatically organizes data into intuitive spatial layouts. It learns how users or teams work and adapts the spatial organization to match their thinking patterns.

### Cognitive API
The system provides an API that allows other applications to query for "spatially related" information, enabling new forms of discovery and insight.

### Dynamic Spatial Relationships
Data relationships are represented spatially - related items are placed close together, creating an intuitive navigation experience that leverages human spatial memory.

## Revenue Models

1. **Enterprise SaaS Subscriptions:** Tiered by storage size and number of users.
2. **Educational Licensing:** Site licenses for universities to revolutionize research and learning.
3. **Cognitive API Fees:** Usage-based fees for accessing the spatial relationship data.
4. **VR/AR Integration Licensing:** Licensing for integration with virtual and augmented reality platforms.
5. **Custom Implementation Services:** Professional services for tailored enterprise implementations.
