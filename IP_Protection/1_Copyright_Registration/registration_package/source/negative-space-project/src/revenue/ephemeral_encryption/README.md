# Ephemeral One-Time-Pad Encryption Service (Project "NyxCom")

This module provides theoretically unbreakable, "one-time-pad" encryption for ultra-secure communications. The key is a continuous stream of random data generated from the ever-changing negative space configuration, used once and then discarded forever.

## Key Components

### EphemeralKeyStream
Generates a continuous stream of ephemeral one-time-pad keys based on synchronized celestial observations. The key is never stored; it is generated, used for a single packet, and then discarded.

### SecureDataEscrow
A service for encrypting data that can only be decrypted when a specific future celestial event occurs. Perfect for dead man's switches, corporate whistleblowing, and long-term data capsules.

### EphemeralEncryptionService
The main service providing methods for secure channel creation, encryption/decryption, and data escrow.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the encryption service
encryption_service = EphemeralEncryptionService()

# Create a secure communication channel
channel = encryption_service.create_secure_channel(
    celestial_objects=["sun", "moon", "mars", "jupiter", "venus"],
    update_frequency=0.5,  # Key updates every 0.5 seconds
    entropy_multiplier=8   # 8x standard entropy for enhanced security
)

session_id = channel["session_id"]

# Encrypt a message
encrypted_message = encryption_service.encrypt_message(
    session_id=session_id,
    message="This is a top-secret message that requires unbreakable encryption"
)

# The recipient would decrypt using the same celestial observations
decrypted_message = encryption_service.decrypt_message(
    session_id=session_id,
    encrypted_data=encrypted_message["encrypted_data"]
)

# Escrow data for future release when a specific celestial event occurs
future_event = {
    "type": "celestial_alignment",
    "objects": ["earth", "moon", "sun"],
    "approximate_time": (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30)).isoformat(),
    "time_window_hours": 48
}

escrow_result = encryption_service.escrow_data(
    data="This data will only be accessible when the specific alignment occurs",
    future_event=future_event,
    metadata={
        "creator": "Whistleblower X",
        "purpose": "Evidence release"
    }
)

# Close the secure channel when done
encryption_service.close_secure_channel(session_id)
```

## Key Security Features

1. **Synchronized Key Generation:** Two parties wishing to communicate synchronize their observation on an agreed-upon set of celestial objects, generating the exact same ephemeral key stream in real-time.

2. **No Stored Keys:** The encryption keys are never stored in any form - they are generated on-demand, used exactly once, and then permanently discarded.

3. **Quantum-Safe by Design:** This isn't just "quantum-resistant"; it's a different paradigm of security that isn't based on mathematical complexity but on physical properties of the universe.

4. **Secure Data Escrow:** Data can be encrypted with a key derived from a future astronomical event, making it impossible to decrypt until that specific event occurs.

## Revenue Models

1. **Secure Communications API:** A per-minute or per-gigabyte fee for using the ephemeral key stream.
2. **Data Escrow Service Fees:** A fee based on the size of the data and the length of the escrow period.
3. **Defense & Intelligence Contracts:** High-value contracts for providing secure communication channels for government and military operations.
