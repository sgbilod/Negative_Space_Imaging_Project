# Celestial Mechanics Derivatives Exchange (Project "CosmoCex")

This module implements a sophisticated financial exchange for trading derivatives based on celestial mechanics. It provides infrastructure for creating and trading structured products including:

1. **Spatial Volatility Indices (SVX)** - Indices tracking the rate of change of configurations in specific sectors of the sky
2. **Celestial Correlation Swaps** - Derivatives that pay out based on the changing correlation between astronomical patterns
3. **Event Options** - Options contracts that give the holder the right to buy or sell a token based on a specific astronomical event occurring within a certain timeframe

## Key Components

### CelestialAsset
Represents a tradable celestial asset with market data and reference information.

### SpatialVolatilityIndex
An index tracking the rate of change of configurations in a specific sector of the sky, using weighted measurements of celestial object movements.

### CelestialCorrelationSwap
A derivative that pays out based on the changing correlation between two astronomical patterns over time.

### CelestialEventOption
An option contract that gives the holder the right to buy or sell based on a specific celestial event occurring within a timeframe.

### AstronomicalPricingEngine
A high-performance engine for pricing complex celestial derivatives using advanced mathematical models and Monte Carlo simulations.

### CelestialMechanicsExchange
The main exchange interface providing methods for asset registration, derivative creation, pricing, and settlement.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the exchange
exchange = CelestialMechanicsExchange(
    spatial_generator=SpatialSignatureGenerator(),
    quantum_ledger=QuantumEntangledLedger(),
    randomness_oracle=AcausalRandomnessOracle()
)

# Create a volatility index
orion_vix = exchange.create_volatility_index({
    "symbol": "ORVIX",
    "name": "Orion Belt Volatility Index",
    "celestial_objects": ["betelgeuse", "rigel", "bellatrix", "mintaka", "alnilam", "alnitak"],
    "measurement_period": "7d",
    "weight_factors": {
        "betelgeuse": 1.5,
        "rigel": 1.2,
        "bellatrix": 1.0,
        "mintaka": 0.8,
        "alnilam": 0.8,
        "alnitak": 0.8
    },
    "base_value": 100.0
})

# Create a correlation swap
swap = exchange.create_correlation_swap({
    "symbol": "SOLMCORR",
    "name": "Solar-Lunar Motion Correlation Swap",
    "pattern_a": {
        "type": "object_positions",
        "objects": ["sun", "mercury", "venus"]
    },
    "pattern_b": {
        "type": "object_positions",
        "objects": ["moon", "earth"]
    },
    "strike_correlation": 0.35,
    "notional_value": 100000.0,
    "expiration_date": (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=90)).isoformat(),
    "issuer_id": "exchange-001"
})

# Update with celestial data
exchange.update_celestial_data(celestial_data)

# Price derivatives
swap_price = exchange.price_correlation_swap(swap.swap_id)
```

## Revenue Streams

1. **Trading & Clearing Fees**: The exchange collects fees on all derivative trades.
2. **Market Data Licensing**: Real-time and historical data feeds are sold to quantitative hedge funds.
3. **Pricing Engine Licensing**: The core pricing engine can be licensed to major financial institutions.

## Integration Points

- **Quantum Entangled Ledger**: Used for trade settlement and verification.
- **Acausal Randomness Oracle**: Provides true randomness for the pricing models.
- **Spatial Signature Generator**: Used for unique identification of celestial patterns.

## Security Considerations

All transactions are secured through the quantum entangled ledger, ensuring immutability and verification. The pricing models incorporate true randomness from acausal sources, making them resistant to manipulation or prediction.
