# Negative Space Mapping System - Patent Documentation

## Title of Invention
System and Method for Multi-Dimensional Void Space Detection and Analysis

## Abstract
A system and method for detecting, analyzing, and characterizing the empty spaces between physical objects in three-dimensional space. The invention provides novel approaches to understanding spatial relationships through the analysis of void spaces rather than object surfaces, enabling new applications in spatial analysis, security, and authentication.

## Technical Field
This invention relates to the field of computer vision and spatial analysis, specifically to the detection and characterization of void spaces between objects in three-dimensional environments.

## Background
Traditional computer vision and spatial analysis systems focus on detecting and analyzing physical objects and their surfaces. However, the spaces between objects—the "negative space"—contains valuable information about spatial relationships and configurations that current systems fail to capture and utilize.

The Negative Space Mapping System provides revolutionary approaches to spatial analysis by:
1. Detecting and characterizing void spaces between objects
2. Analyzing interstitial space relationships
3. Generating unique spatial signatures from void configurations
4. Creating mathematical models of spatial relationships
