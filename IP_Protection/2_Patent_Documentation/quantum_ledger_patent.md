# Quantum Ledger System - Patent Documentation

## Title of Invention
System and Method for Quantum-Entangled Digital Ledger with Spatial-Temporal Verification

## Abstract
A system and method for creating and maintaining a digital ledger system that utilizes quantum entanglement principles and spatial-temporal signatures for verification and authentication. The system combines blockchain technology with quantum state observation and astronomical spatial relationships to create unforgeable transaction records.

## Technical Field
