However, this\nresults in corners appearing \"rounded\", which may not be the desired\nbehavior if you are drawing, for example, a polygon or pointed star.\n\n**Supported values:**\n\n.. rst-class:: value-list\n\n    'miter'\n        the \"arrow-tip\" style. Each boundary of the filled-in area will\n        extend in a straight line parallel to the tangent vector of the\n        centerline at the point it meets the corner, until they meet in a\n        sharp point.\n    'round'\n        stokes every point within a radius of ``linewidth/2`` of the center\n        lines.\n    'bevel'\n        the \"squared-off\" style. It can be thought of as a rounded corner\n        where the \"circular\" part of the corner has been cut off.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Very long miter tips are cut off (to form a *bevel*) after a\n    backend-dependent limit called the \"miter limit\", which specifies the\n    maximum allowed ratio of miter length to line width. For example, the\n    PDF backend uses the default value of 10 specified by the PDF standard,\n    while the SVG backend does not even specify the miter limit, resulting\n    in a default value of 4 per the SVG specification. Matplotlib does not\n    currently allow the user to adjust this parameter.\n\n    A more detailed description of the effect of a miter limit can be found\n    in the `Mozilla Developer Docs\n    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-miterlimit>`_\n\n.. plot::\n    :alt: Demo of possible JoinStyle's\n\n    from matplotlib._enums import JoinStyle\n    JoinStyle.demo()",
