      "docstring": "CID to Glyph ID table\n\nThe AAT ``cidg`` table has almost the same structure as ``gidc``,\njust mapping CIDs to GlyphIDs instead of the reverse direction.\n\nIt is useful for fonts that may be used by a PDF renderer in lieu of\na font reference with a known glyph collection but no subsetted\nglyphs.  For instance, a PDF can say \u201cplease use a font conforming\nto Adobe-Japan-1\u201d; the ``cidg`` mapping is necessary if the font is,\nsay, a TrueType font.  ``gidc`` is lossy for this purpose and is\nobsoleted by ``cidg``.\n\nFor example, the first font in ``/System/Library/Fonts/PingFang.ttc``\n(which Apple ships pre-installed on MacOS 10.12.6) has a ``cidg`` table.\n\nSee also https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6gcid.html",
