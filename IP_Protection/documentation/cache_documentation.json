We therefore have\nadditional logic that makes sure that both files to be present before\nreturning an entry; this fixes the read side of the race condition.\n\nFor the write side, we assume that the server will only ever return the\nsame data for the same URL, which ought to be the case for files pip is\ndownloading.  PyPI does not have a mechanism to swap out a wheel for\nanother wheel, for example.  If this assumption is not true, the\nCacheControl issue will need to be fixed.",
