This function determines an appropriate name for the\noutput file, through one or more of the following steps:\n\n- changing the output directory\n- appending suffix before file extension\n- replacing the file extension\n- suffixing the filename with a number (``#1``, ``#2``, etc.) to avoid\n  overwriting an existing file.\n\nArgs:\n    input: Name of input file.\n    outputDir: Optionally, a new directory to write the file into.\n    suffix: Optionally, a string suffix is appended to file name before\n        the extension.\n    extension: Optionally, a replacement for the current file extension.\n    overWrite: Overwriting an existing file is permitted if true; if false\n        and the proposed filename exists, a new name will be generated by\n        adding an appropriate number suffix.\n\nReturns:\n    str: Suitable output filename"
