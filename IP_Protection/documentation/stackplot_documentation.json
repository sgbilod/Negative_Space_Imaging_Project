      "docstring": "Draw a stacked area plot or a streamgraph.\n\nParameters\n----------\nx : (N,) array-like\n\ny : (M, N) array-like\n    The data can be either stacked or unstacked. Each of the following\n    calls is legal::\n\n        stackplot(x, y)  # where y has shape (M, N) e.g. y = [y1, y2, y3, y4]\n        stackplot(x, y1, y2, y3, y4)  # where y1, y2, y3, y4 have length N\n\nbaseline : {'zero', 'sym', 'wiggle', 'weighted_wiggle'}\n    Method used to calculate the baseline:\n\n    - ``'zero'``: Constant zero baseline, i.e. a simple stacked plot.\n    - ``'sym'``:  Symmetric around zero and is sometimes called\n      'ThemeRiver'.\n    - ``'wiggle'``: Minimizes the sum of the squared slopes.\n    - ``'weighted_wiggle'``: Does the same but weights to account for\n      size of each layer. It is also called 'Streamgraph'-layout. More\n      details can be found at http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/.\n\nlabels : list of str, optional\n    A sequence of labels to assign to each data series. If unspecified,\n    then no labels will be applied to artists.\n\ncolors : list of :mpltype:`color`, optional\n    A sequence of colors to be cycled through and used to color the stacked\n    areas. The sequence need not be exactly the same length as the number\n    of provided *y*, in which case the colors will repeat from the\n    beginning.\n\n    If not specified, the colors from the Axes property cycle will be used.\n\nhatch : list of str, default: None\n    A sequence of hatching styles.  See\n    :doc:`/gallery/shapes_and_collections/hatch_style_reference`.\n    The sequence will be cycled through for filling the\n    stacked areas from bottom to top.\n    It need not be exactly the same length as the number\n    of provided *y*, in which case the styles will repeat from the\n    beginning.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 3.9\n       Support for list input\n\ndata : indexable object, optional\n    DATA_PARAMETER_PLACEHOLDER\n\n**kwargs\n    All other keyword arguments are passed to `.Axes.fill_between`.\n\nReturns\n-------\nlist of `.PolyCollection`\n    A list of `.PolyCollection` instances, one for each element in the\n    stacked area plot."
