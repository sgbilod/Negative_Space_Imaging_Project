## Basic Concepts

### Negative Space Analysis

Negative space refers to the areas between or around the main subjects in an image. In astronomical and medical imaging, these spaces can contain valuable information that might be overlooked by traditional analysis techniques.

Our system analyzes these regions to:
- Detect subtle structures and patterns
- Identify relationships between objects
- Highlight anomalies and unusual formations
- Enhance the visibility of low-contrast features

### Secure Multi-Party Verification

The system implements a multi-signature verification framework to ensure:
- Data integrity through cryptographic verification
- Authorization by multiple stakeholders
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
- Non-repudiation of processing results

Three signature modes are supported:
1. **Threshold Mode**: Requires a minimum number of signatures from any authorized signers
2. **Sequential Mode**: Requires signatures in a specific order (e.g., Analyst → Supervisor → Compliance Officer)
3. **Role-Based Mode**: Requires signatures from specific roles regardless of order

## Getting Started

### Your First Negative Space Analysis

1. **Prepare an image**:
   - Use an existing astronomical or medical image
   - Or generate a test image with `python create_test_image.py`

2. **Run the secure workflow**:
   ```bash
   python secure_imaging_workflow.py --mode threshold --signatures 3 --threshold 2
   ```

3. **View the results**:
   - Processing results are saved to the `output` directory
   - Audit information is saved to `security_audit.json`

### Using the CLI Interface

For a more streamlined experience, use the command-line interface:

```bash
python cli.py workflow --mode threshold --signatures 3 --threshold 2
```

Additional commands:
```bash
python cli.py acquisition --source file --path ./my_image.raw
python cli.py process --input ./my_image.raw --output ./processed/
python cli.py verify --request abc123 --signer supervisor
```

## Core Functionalities

### Image Acquisition

The system supports multiple acquisition methods:

- **Local Files**: Load images from your local filesystem
  ```bash
  python demo_acquisition.py --mode local --source path/to/image.raw
  ```

- **Remote URLs**: Download images from secure servers
  ```bash
  python demo_acquisition.py --mode remote --source https://example.com/image.jpg
  ```

- **Simulation**: Generate test images with configurable parameters
  ```bash
  python demo_acquisition.py --mode simulation --width 1024 --height 1024
  ```

### Image Processing

The processing pipeline includes:

1. **Preprocessing**: Normalization, noise reduction, and enhancement
2. **Negative Space Detection**: Identification of relevant regions
3. **Feature Extraction**: Analysis of structures within negative spaces
4. **Result Generation**: Production of processed images and metadata

Run the processing step independently:
```bash
python cli.py process --input ./my_image.raw --output ./processed/
```

### Verification System

The verification system ensures:

- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of processing results
- **Authorization**: Approval by designated stakeholders
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all verification actions

Verification can be performed through the secure workflow or independently:
```bash
python cli.py verify --request abc123 --signer analyst
```

## Secure Workflow

The secure workflow integrates acquisition, processing, and verification into a seamless pipeline with comprehensive security controls.

### Workflow Phases

1. **Acquisition Phase**:
   - Secure image loading from trusted sources
   - Integrity verification through cryptographic hashing
   - Metadata generation for provenance tracking

2. **Processing Phase**:
   - Secure execution of negative space algorithms
   - Isolation of processing environment
   - Generation of verifiable processing results

3. **Verification Phase**:
   - Creation of signature requests
   - Collection of required signatures
   - Validation against security policies

### Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Tamper Detection**: Cryptographic verification prevents unauthorized modifications
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions are logged for audit purposes
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Permissions based on user roles
- **Non-Repudiation**: Cryptographic signatures ensure accountability

## Command-line Interface

## Multi-Signature Verification

The multi-signature system ensures that processing results are verified by the appropriate stakeholders before being considered valid.

### Signature Modes

#### Threshold Mode

Requires a minimum number of signatures from any authorized signers.

```bash
python multi_signature_demo.py --mode threshold --signatures 5 --threshold 3
```

This requires at least 3 out of 5 authorized signers to approve the results.

#### Sequential Mode

Requires signatures in a specific predefined order.

```bash
python multi_signature_demo.py --mode sequential --signatures 3
```

This requires signers to approve in sequence (e.g., Analyst → Supervisor → Compliance Officer).

#### Role-Based Mode

Requires signatures from specific roles regardless of order.

```bash
python multi_signature_demo.py --mode role-based
```

This requires one signature from each required role (e.g., Analyst, Supervisor, Compliance Officer).

### Verification Process

1. **Request Creation**: A signature request is created for the processing result
2. **Signing**: Authorized signers review and sign the request
3. **Verification**: The system verifies that signature requirements are met
4. **Audit**: All verification actions are recorded in the audit log

## Image Acquisition

The image acquisition module provides a flexible framework for loading images from various sources.

### Acquisition Modes

#### Local File

python demo_acquisition.py --mode local --source path/to/image.raw
```

Loads an image from the local filesystem with security checks to ensure the file's integrity.

#### Remote HTTP

```bash
python demo_acquisition.py --mode remote --source https://example.com/image.jpg
```

Downloads an image from a remote server with security checks to ensure the source's authenticity.

#### Simulation
