# Sovereign Control System - Security Enhancement

## Overview

This update adds comprehensive security features to the Sovereign Control System, including:

- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption and data protection
- Role-based access control
- Security monitoring and audit logging
- Web security features (CSRF, XSS protection, etc.)

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Initialize the database:

```bash
python -m sovereign.setup --init-security
```

## Running the Secure System

1. Start the web server:

```bash
python -m sovereign.web_interface
```

2. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000

3. Log in with the default administrator account:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: sovereign_admin_2025

4. Change the default password immediately after first login

## Testing the Security Implementation

1. Start the web server as described above

2. In a separate terminal, run the security tests:

```bash
python -m sovereign.security_test
```

## Security Features

### Authentication

- Multi-factor user authentication
- Strong password policies
- Session management
- Brute force protection

### Encryption

- AES-256-GCM encryption
- Secure key management
- Quantum-resistant options
- File integrity verification

### Access Control

- Role-based access control
- Fine-grained permissions
- Session-based authorization
- IP-based restrictions

### Security Monitoring

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Intrusion detection
- Security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection

## Configuration

Security settings can be configured through:

1. Web interface at `/security/settings`
2. Command-line interface (`python -m sovereign.security_cli`)
3. Configuration files (`config/security.json`)

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see:

- [Security Guide](./docs/SECURITY.md)
- [API Reference](./docs/API.md)
- [Administrator Guide](./docs/ADMIN.md)

## Security Levels

The system supports four security levels:

1. **STANDARD**: Basic security for non-critical environments
2. **ENHANCED**: Improved security with stronger encryption
3. **MAXIMUM**: Highest level of security with comprehensive protections
4. **QUANTUM**: Future-proof security with quantum-resistant algorithms
