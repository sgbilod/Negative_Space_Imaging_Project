# Sovereign Intelligence Protocol

**Status:** INITIATED
**Date:** August 14, 2025

## Protocol Overview
This protocol governs the automation, security, and intelligence operations for the AI-Powered Content Monetization Network (AICMN) and all related projects.

### Core Actions
1. Activate automation scripts for project creation, migration, and onboarding.
2. Enforce author and ownership via CODEOWNERS and documentation.
3. Apply CI/CD workflows for continuous integration and security.
4. Centralize project tracking in `portfolio_index.md` and `automation_status.md`.
5. Audit and migrate all existing projects to the new structure.
6. Document all actions and updates in this protocol file.

---

## Next Steps
- Run `migrate_existing_projects.ps1` to audit and organize all projects.
- Use `new_project.ps1` for new project scaffolding.
- Update dashboards and protocol status after each major action.
- Review onboarding and CI/CD guides for compliance.

**Protocol is now active. All automation and intelligence operations will be tracked and documented here.**
